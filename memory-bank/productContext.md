# Product Context

## Business Purpose
The Shipping Management System is designed to solve several critical challenges faced by international vehicle shipping and logistics companies:

1. **Information Transparency**: Customers often struggle to get clear updates on the status of their shipped vehicles, leading to anxiety and support overhead.

2. **Document Management**: International shipping requires numerous documents (customs forms, purchase agreements, invoices) that are often managed through email, leading to disorganization and lost paperwork.

3. **Communication Silos**: Without a centralized system, customer inquiries get scattered across different channels (email, phone, text) making it difficult to provide consistent support.

4. **Administrative Overhead**: Admin staff spend excessive time tracking down information in different systems and handling repetitive inquiries that could be self-served.
