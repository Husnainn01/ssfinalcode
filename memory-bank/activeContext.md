# Active Context

## Current Focus
We are currently focused on improving the admin dashboard's inquiry management system, specifically:

1. **Fixing the Archive Functionality**
   - Replaced browser's native `confirm()` dialog with the custom AlertDialog component
   - Properly set up the dialog to confirm before archiving inquiries
   - Fixed the flow for handling different inquiry statuses during archiving

2. **Database Collection Integration**
   - Working with the `customerInquiries` collection for storing inquiry data
   - Ensuring proper handling of the `isArchived` field for filtering inquiries
   - Maintaining connections between inquiries and vehicles in the `agreedvehicles` collection

3. **UI Components**
   - Utilizing the AlertDialog component from the UI library 
   - Making sure components are correctly imported and used
   - Ensuring responsive and consistent UI across the admin dashboard

## Recent Changes

1. **Inquiry Archive Flow**
   - Replaced browser's native confirmation dialog with custom AlertDialog component
   - Added state variables to track dialog open state and the inquiry to be archived
   - Split handling logic into two functions: 
     - `handleArchive()`: Checks conditions and shows dialog if needed
     - `archiveInquiry()`: Performs the actual archive operation

2. **API Integration**
   - Ensuring archive API endpoint uses the correct collection (`customerInquiries`)
   - Added proper handling for inquiries without the `isArchived` field
   - Connected inquiry archiving with related vehicle data when applicable

3. **UI Improvements**
   - Added button to view archived inquiries
   - Implemented proper confirmation dialogs using AlertDialog
   - Fixed status indicators and action buttons

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Archive Functionality**
   - Verify that archived inquiries are properly filtered from the main list
   - Ensure the archive endpoint correctly sets the `isArchived` flag
   - Test the archive/unarchive workflow thoroughly

2. **Improve Inquiry Filtering**
   - Enhance MongoDB query construction to handle missing fields
   - Add diagnostic logging to troubleshoot data retrieval issues
   - Optimize the filtering logic for better performance

3. **Enhance UI Experience**
   - Implement advanced filtering and search capabilities
   - Add pagination for large datasets
   - Create additional UI feedback for user actions

## Active Decisions

1. **Archive Implementation Approach**
   - Using an `isArchived` flag rather than moving data to a separate collection
   - This simplifies data management while maintaining query performance
   
2. **Dialog Component Usage**
   - Using AlertDialog for confirmations instead of browser prompts
   - This provides a consistent and branded user experience

3. **Collection Structure**
   - Maintaining separate collections for different entity types
   - Using references (IDs) to link related data across collections
   - This approach balances flexibility with performance
