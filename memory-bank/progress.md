## Known Issues

1. **Archive Dialog**: Browser default confirm dialog was showing instead of the custom AlertDialog component (FIXED)

2. **Database Collections**: Need to ensure queries work with the correct collections:
   - `customerInquiries` for inquiries
   - `agreedvehicles` for vehicles

3. **Field Handling**: Some documents might not have the `isArchived` field, causing filtering issues

4. **UI Responsiveness**: Some tables might overflow on smaller screens

5. **Vehicle Reference**: Some inquiries might have incorrectly formatted vehicle references
